# Google-Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-LSTM
Google Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM is a specific project or task that involves using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM model to predict future Google stock prices by analysing historical stock price data.LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can recognise patterns and dependencies in sequential data, which makes it appropriate for time series forecasting applications such as stock price prediction.And in this project an array containing the first 60 open stock prices would be the first entry in the X_train, and the 61st open stock price value would be the first item in the Y_train.This means that if we give our model the previous 60 values, we want it to forecast the 61st value of the stock price.
